        <h1>ES6 coding challenge</h1>
        <p> Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li> 1. Parks</li>
            <li> 2. Streets</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a build year.
            At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li> 1. Tree density of each park in the town (forumla: number of trees/park area)</li>
            <li> 2. Average age of each town's park (forumla: sum of all ages/number of parks)</li>
            <li> 3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees</li>
            <li> 4. Total and average length of the town's streets</li>
            <li> 5. Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All the report data should be printed to the console.
            HINT: Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parameters, maps, arrow functions, destructuring, etc.
        </p>
